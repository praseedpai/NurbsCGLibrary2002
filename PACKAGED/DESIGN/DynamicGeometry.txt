Aim
========================

Java3D primitive array and its subclasses are static in nature. While doing interactive editing
of primitives in a CAD system , This creates more problems. 

classes 
            DynamicGeometryArray 
            DynamicTriangleArray
            DynamicQuadArray
            DynamicPolygonArray


Since the Shape3D node expects a GeometryArray ( or its subclass ) ,These classes needs
to extend GeometryArray. At the same time the sub-class has to act as a container to 
GoemtryArray.
